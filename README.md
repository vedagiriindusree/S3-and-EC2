## Aim

- Sign up and configure an AWS account.
- Create and manage IAM roles and users.
- Launch and connect to an EC2 instance.
- Install and configure AWS CLI on Windows.
- Understand AWS Free Tier usage.
- Explore AWS documentation and core services (EC2, S3, IAM, etc.).

## Algorithm

1. Sign up for an AWS account using the AWS Console.
2. Set up IAM users and assign required permissions.
3. Log in to AWS Management Console and explore key services.
4. Launch a new EC2 instance with proper configurations.
5. Create and download a key pair (.pem).
6. Configure a security group with necessary inbound rules.
7. Connect to the EC2 instance using PowerShell or PuTTY (on Windows).
8. Install AWS CLI for Windows and run `aws configure` to set up credentials.

## Procedure

### 1. AWS Account Setup

#### Connecting to EC2 from Windows:

- **Using PowerShell** (with OpenSSH):
  ```powershell
  ssh -i path\to\your-key.pem ec2-user@your-instance-public-ip
  
### Using PuTTY:

- Convert `.pem` to `.ppk` using **PuTTYgen**.
- Use **PuTTY** to SSH into your instance using the public IP address and `.ppk` key.
